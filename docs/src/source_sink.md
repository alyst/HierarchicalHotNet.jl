# [Source-Sink Analysis](@id source_sink)

For any edge weight threshold *t*, cutting the [*strongly connected components (SCC) tree*](@ref scctree)
provides the set of SCC of the original directed weighted network.
Within each SCC subnetwork, there is a path from any node to any other node along
the edges with weights not smaller than *t*. The original network may still contain
the other edges with weights *â‰¥t*, which can connect one SCC subnetwork to the
other, but it is not possible to reenter the same SCC again by traveling along
these edges (otherwise by definition there is a bigger SCC). In other words,
for each *t* we have a *direct acyclic graph* of connections between SCCs.

This property makes it very convenient to enumerate all paths from one set of nodes
(*sources*) to the other (*sinks*). It is implemented by the [`flowgraph()`](@ref HierarchicalHotNet.flowgraph) method.
One can use it to identify signaling subnetworks that connect one biological
data (e.g. interactors of a particular protein) to another (e.g. downstream
changes resulting from knock out or overexpressing this protein).

The output of [`flowgraph()`](@ref HierarchicalHotNet.flowgraph) is the subnetwork that consists of selected SCCs
and the edges that connect these SCCs, plus the list of paths within this subnetwork
from *source* to *sink* nodes. It could be shown that the path lengths tend
to be smaller for the diffusion networks based on the real data than the ones
based on the reshuffled node weights.

## [Network Metrics](@id network_metrics)

It's is important to have a way to check the relevance of *HierarchicalHotNet* predictions.
For example, one can [randomize the input data](@ref permweights) and show that, at some edge weight
threshold ``t_*``, *HHotNet* predictions based on the real data, ``H(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{real}}, t_*)``,
demnostrate significantly more order than the ones based on randomized data,
``H(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{perm}}^i, t_*)``, ``i=1,2,\ldots,N_{\mathrm{perm}}``.
If the "order" could be expressed as some metric ``m(H)``, then we can easily define
the ``p``-value for the hypothesis that ``H(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{real}}, t)`` is significantly
more "ordered" than expected by chance:
```math
p_m(H(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{real}}, t)) = P\big(M_{\mathrm{perm}}(t) \geq m(H(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{real}}, t)) \big),
```
where ``M_{\mathrm{perm}}(t)`` is a random variable derived from the empirical distribution
of ``m(H(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{perm}}^i, t))``, ``i = 1, 2, \ldots, N_{\mathrm{perm}}``.
The definition above was given for the case of ``m(H)`` growing with the increase of ``H`` "order".
If the metric ``m`` decreases as the "order" of ``H`` grows, ``P(M \geq m(H))`` should be changed
to ``P(M \leq m(H))``.

In [_M.A. Reyna et al_ (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/17/i972/5093236),
the ``m_{\max\mathrm{size}}(H)`` metric -- the size of the maximal strongly connected component -- was used,
and it was shown that ``m_{\max\mathrm{size}}(H(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{real}}, t))`` is statistically significantly larger
than at random for some ``t_*``. [`treecut_stats()`](@ref HierarchicalHotNet.treecut_stats) provides ``m_{\max\mathrm{size}}(t)``
in `maxcomponent_size` column.
It is also possible to use the total size of top *N* components (`topn_components_sizesum` column) or the number of
non-trivial (larger than single node) SCCs (`ncomponents_nontrivial` column) for the same purpose.

### [Flow Metrics](@id sourcesink_metrics)

Metrics like ``m_{\max\mathrm{size}}(H)`` could be used for the analysis of significantly perturbed subnetworks,
but they don't allow estimating how strong is the relationship between sources and sinks.
The source-to-sink flows analysis requires different metrics. The one that shows good results is *the average inverse of flow length*:
```math
L_{\mathrm{avg}}^{-1}(H) = \frac{1}{N_{\mathrm{source}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{sink}}} \sum_{f \in \mathrm{flows}(H)} \frac{1}{N_{\mathrm{SCC}}(f)},
```
where ``N_{\mathrm{source}}`` and ``N_{\mathrm{sink}}`` are the numbers of sources and sinks, respectively
(so ``N_{\mathrm{source}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{sink}}`` is the number of all possible distinct flows),
``\mathrm{flows}(H)`` are all the source-to-sink flows of ``H``, and ``N_{\mathrm{SCC}}(f)`` is the
number of distinct strongly connected components that contain the nodes of the ``f`` flow.
This metric changes from 1 (all sources and sinks in the same strongly connected component) to 0
(no or infinitely long flows).
This metric is available as `flow_avginvlen` column in the [`treecut_stats()`](@ref HierarchicalHotNet.treecut_stats) output.

The alternative metrics for the flow analysis provided by [`treecut_stats()`](@ref HierarchicalHotNet.treecut_stats) are:
 * the average transition probability of the flow (`flow_avgweight` column):
```math
w_{\mathrm{avg. flow}}(H) = \frac{1}{N_{\mathrm{src}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{sink}}} \sum_{f \in \mathrm{flows}(H)} \min \big( w(\mathrm{source}(f), \mathrm{sink}(f)), w_{\max} \big),
```
where ``w(i, j)`` is the transition probability from ``i``-th to ``j``-th node in the random walk with restart.
The distribution of ``w(i, j)`` is essentially non-gaussian, and to limit the strong influence of a few "outliers" on the
total ``w_{\mathrm{avg. flow}}(H)``, some ``w_{\max}`` constant is used.
* the average flow transition probability per SCC (`flow_avghopweight` column):
```math
w_{\mathrm{avg. hop}}(H) = \frac{1}{N_{\mathrm{src}} \cdot N_{\mathrm{sink}}} \sum_{f \in \mathrm{flows}(H)} \frac{\min \big( w(\mathrm{source}(f), \mathrm{sink}(f)), w_{\max} \big)}{N_{\mathrm{SCC}}(f)},
```
